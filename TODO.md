# TODO

- [ ] Fix: Initial load `pointString` validation (make sure all talents are valid and their deps are met)
- [ ] Fix: Tooltips cause horizontal scroll on less-wide screens. Investigate.

- [ ] Responsiveness:
  - [ ] Tooltips on mobile need different UX
- [ ] Talent tree: 
  - [ ] Reset button per tree (?)
- [ ] Tooltips: 
  - [ ] Support multiple positions for tooltip (currently only `top-right` with fallbacks based on viewport)
- [ ] Move icons back under `/src` when https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6060 is released as part of 3.0.2
